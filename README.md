### Introduction

This is the repository for my undergrad capstone project at Saint Louis University for the B.A. in Sociology. This project initialized during my last semester (fall 2018) and was completed in December, 2018, lasting six months. I then presented the project to the faculty of the department of Sociology and Anthropology at SLU.

This project focuses on the impact of race on socioeconomic status among respondents from the `General Social Survey - 2016`. A statistical regression model was used as the theoretical framework to examine the differences in SES, with socioeconomic status as the dependent variable. Class-indicator variables such as working status, income, and education act as independent variables, attempting to explain as much variation as possible in SES scores. 

Ultimately, social factors such as racial residential segregation, employment discrimination, educational discrimination, and class inequality negatively affect African Americans in metropolitan cities, corresponding with current literature on the topic of urban race-relations.

### Repository Contents

* The `data` folder contains all data, raw/clean, used for this analysis.
* The `documentation` folder consists of the R project notebooks for each section of the analysis.
* The `results` folder includes images of the regression tables and other descriptive graphs.
* The `source` folder contains functions to make the R workflow easier.

### Acknowledgements

I would like to specifically thank `Dr. Chris Prener` for being an outstanding mentor to me during the extent of this project. His progressive milestones and checkpoints allowed me to produce the best project in the amount of time possible. He also pushed and challenged my own assumptions along the way to ensure that this project was solid when it came time to present it to the faculty of the department.
